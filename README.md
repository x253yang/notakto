Implements the game based on this numberphile video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h09XU8t8eUM

Notakto is tic-tac-toe where both players use x, with an arbitrary number of 3x3 boards, and the player that eliminates the last board loses.

Options: 
Players: Human vs human / human vs ai / ai vs human / ai vs ai.
The AI can be set to easy (random moves) or hard (optimal moves).

To compile, use the Makefile and enter make notakto in the command line. Run as ./notakto
